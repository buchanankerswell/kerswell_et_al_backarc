\section{Introduction}

Heat escaping the solid Earth's surface indicates a dynamically cooling
planet. Surface heat flow databases (Hasterok \& Chapman, 2008;
Lucazeau, 2019; Pollack et al., 1993) provide a way to understand
geodynamics by relating the amount of heat escaping Earth's surface to
heat-transferring and heat-generating subsurface processes such as
diffusion, hydrothermal circulation, radioactive decay, fault motion,
subduction dynamics, and mantle convection (Currie et al., 2004; Currie
\& Hyndman, 2006; Fourier, 1827; Furlong \& Chapman, 2013; Furukawa,
1993; Gao \& Wang, 2014; Hasterok, 2013; Kerswell et al., 2020; Parsons
\& Sclater, 1977; Pollack \& Chapman, 1977; Rudnick et al., 1998; Stein
\& Stein, 1992, 1994; Wada \& Wang, 2009). Surface heat flow
observations continue to motivate research, evident by more than 1,393
publications compiled in the most recent heat flow dataset, although the
rate of publications using surface heat flow has declined since the mid
1980's (Jennings \& Hasterok, 2021).

Many research questions, such as calculating the global surface heat
flux from continents and oceans, require interpolating discrete heat
flow observations onto a continuous approximation of Earth's surface.
Previous attempts at interpolation use one or more geographic, geologic,
geochronologic, or geophysical proxies to predict heat flow at unknown
locations by association with similar observation sites (e.g.,
bathymetry or elevation, proximity to active or ancient orogens,
seafloor age, upper mantle shear wave velocities, Chapman \& Pollack,
1975; Davies, 2013; Goutorbe et al., 2011; Lee \& Uyeda, 1965; Lucazeau,
2019; Sclater \& Francheteau, 1970; Shapiro \& Ritzwoller, 2004). These
methods are called \emph{similarity methods} (Figure~\ref{fig:lucahf}).
The success of such interpolations are typically evaluated statistically
by the misfit between the predicted and observed heat flow. However,
even statistically-successful heat flow interpolations are difficult to
interpret and show unexpected anomalies (Lucazeau, 2019). The fidelity
and usefulness of interpolations depend on the question being asked and
the choice of methodology.

\end{figure}

Predicting surface heat flow by association with physical proxies is
arguably the most reasonable approach to interpolation for global
investigations. Our understanding of geodynamics and near-surface heat
flow perturbations implies that the variance in surface heat flow is not
uniformly stochastic, but rather, in large part, determined by the
physical conditions and processes operating locally (e.g., Goutorbe et
al., 2011). For example, younger oceanic plates should have higher
surface heat flow than older plates (Stein \& Stein, 1992), subducting
oceanic plates will lower surface heat flow near trenches (Furukawa,
1993), and hydrothermal circulation of seawater can modify heat flow in
oceanic crust (Hasterok et al., 2011). Interpolation by association with
physical proxies makes reasoned predictions of heat flow based on many
independently-tested geodynamic models. However, similarity methods are
strongly biased towards such models and risk making determinations
where, in fact, surprising results and idiosyncrasies may be found.

In contrast, there exists some degree of stationarity, spatial
dependence, or continuity, in the distribution of surface heat flow. A
pair of surface heat flow observations taken one meter apart will be
strongly correlated. The correlation between pairs of observations will
likely decrease with increasing distance between the pairs (Goovaerts,
1997). The spatial (dis)continuity of surface heat flow represents the
areal extent of geodynamic processes and their interactions. For
example, consistent patterns of heat flow near volcanic arcs are
interpreted to reflect common backarc lithospheric thermal structures
and slab-mantle mechanical coupling depths in subduction zones
(Furukawa, 1993; Kerswell et al., 2020; Wada \& Wang, 2009).

In theory, one may predict surface heat flow at unknown locations by
considering many nearby observations (i.e.~Kriging, Krige, 1951).
However, Kriging is disadvantageous for global interpolations of surface
heat flow because it assumes that the underlying distribution of heat
flow is stationary (constant in space), which effectively ignores
geodynamic complexity. One can overcome this problem by relaxing
assumptions of stationarity, or applying Markov-Bayes techniques to
include proxies as priors (Bárdossy, 1997). Instead, we leverage the
properties of stationarity as a tool for comparison with
\emph{similarity} methods of interpolation (Goutorbe et al., 2011;
Lucazeau, 2019). So the questions are: 1) What are the differences
between Kriging and similarity methods? 2) What are the implications of
the differences according to the implicit assumptions in both methods?

We attempt to answer these questions by using ordinary Kriging to
interpolate the New Global Heat Flow (NGHF) dataset of Lucazeau (2019).
Our method is optimized using a genetic algorithm to minimize an
objective function which considers both the misfit on the variogram
models and interpolation results (after Li et al., 2018). We then
compare our interpolation results to those of Lucazeau (2019) and
consider the implications of Kriging vs.~similarity methods of
interpolation. We restrict our comparison to areas near subduction zone
segments defined by Syracuse \& Abers (2006) for two reasons: 1) to
provide maps and statistics useful to subduction zone research, and 2)
to emphasize differences and idiosyncrasies in both interpolation
approaches in a complex tectonic and thermal setting.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{The NGHF Dataset}

The NGHF dataset was downloaded from the supplementary material of
Lucazeau (2019). It contains 69729 data points, their locations in
latitude/longitude, and metadata---including a data quality rank (Code
6) from A to D (with Code 6 = Z = undetermined). The reader is referred
to Lucazeau (2019) for details on compilation, references, and
historical perspective on the NGHF and previous compilations. We use
NGFH because it is the most recent dataset available, has been carefully
compiled, and is open-access.

Like Lucazeau (2019), we exclude 4790 poor quality observations (Code 6
= D) from our analysis. We further remove 350 data points without heat
flow observations and two without geographic information. Multiple
observations at the same location are parsed to avoid singular
covariance matrices during Kriging:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:parse}{}{\begin{aligned}
    f(X_i^q, Y_i^q) &= \\
    X_i^q > Y_i^q &\rightarrow z_i = x_i \\
    X_i^q < Y_i^q &\rightarrow z_i = y_i \\
    X_i^q = Y_i^q &\rightarrow z_i = RAND(x_i, y_i)
    \end{aligned}}\label{eq:parse}\end{equation}

where \(X_i^q\) and \(Y_i^q\) represent the quality of each duplicate
observation pair at location \(i\), \(RAND\) is a random function that
selects either the observation \(x_i\) or \(y_i\), and \(z_i\) stores
the observation selected by \(f(X_i^q, Y_i^q)\). The final dataset used
for Kriging has \(n=\) 55274 observations after parsing \(n=\) 32430
duplicate observation.

\subsection{Kriging}

Kriging is a three-step process that involves first estimating an
experimental variogram, \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\), fitting the experimental
variogram with one of many variogram models, \(\gamma(h)\), and finally
using the modelled variogram to predict random variables at unknown
locations (Cressie, 2015; Krige, 1951). We use the general-purpose
functions defined in the ``R'' package \texttt{gstat} (Gräler et al.,
2016; Pebesma, 2004) to perform all three steps. We begin by estimating
an experimental variogram as defined by Bárdossy (1997):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:variogram}{}{\hat{\gamma}(h) = \frac{1}{2N(h)}\sum_{N(h)}^{}(Z(u_i) - Z(u_j))^2}\label{eq:variogram}\end{equation}

where \(N(h)\) is the number of pairs of points, \(Z(u_i)\) and
\(Z(u_j)\), separated by a lag distance, \(h = |u_i - u_j|\). We
evaluate \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\) at fifteen lag distances by binning the
irregular spaced data with a bin width, \(\delta\), equal to one-third
of the maximum lag distance divided by the number of lags used to
evaluate the variogram, \(\delta = \max (N(h))/(3\cdot 15)\). Then
\(N(h) \leftarrow N(h, \delta h) = \{i,j:|u_i - u_j| \in [h - \delta h, h + \delta h)\}\).
In simple terms, Equation~\ref{eq:variogram} represents the similarity,
or dissimilarity, between pairs of observations in space.
Equation~\ref{eq:variogram} is derived from the theory of
\emph{regionalized variables} (Matheron, 1963, 2019), which formally
defines a probabilistic framework for spatial interpolation of natural
phenomena. It is important for the reader to understand the fundamental
assumptions implicit in Equation~\ref{eq:variogram} in order to
understand the comparison of interpolation techniques discussed later.
The basic assumptions used in our Kriging method are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\) is directionally invariant (isotropic)
\item
  \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\) is evaluated in two-dimensions and neglects
  elevation, \(Z(u) \in \mathbb{R}^2\)
\item
  The first and second moments of \(Z(u)\) have the following conditions
  over the domain \(D\):

  \begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:assumptions}{}{\begin{aligned}
        &E[Z(u)] = mean = constant, &\forall u \in D \\
        &E[(Z(u + h) - mean)(Z(u) - mean)] = C(h), &\forall |u, u + h| \in D
        \end{aligned}}\label{eq:assumptions}\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The last assumption (Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions}) is called
``second-order stationarity'' and is commonly used in practice. It
assumes the underlying probability distribution of the random variable,
\(Z(u)\), does not change in space and the covariance, \(C(h)\), only
depends on the distance, \(h\), between two random variables. These
assumptions are expected to be valid in cases where the underlying
natural process is stochastic, spatially continuous, and has the
property of additivity such that \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n Z(u_i)\) has
the same meaning as \(Z(u)\) (Bárdossy, 1997).

The following are two illustrative cases where
Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions} is likely valid:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The thickness of a sedimentary unit with a homogeneous concentration
  of radioactive elements can be approximated by
  \(q_s = q_b + \int A \,dz\), where \(q_b\) is a constant heat flux
  entering the bottom of the layer and \(A\) is the heat production
  within the layer with thickness \(z\) (Furlong \& Chapman, 2013). If
  we have two samples, \(Z(u_1) = 31~mW/m^2\) and
  \(Z(u_2) = 30.5~mW/m^2\), their corresponding thicknesses would be
  \(Z'(u_1) = 1000~m\) and \(Z'(u_2) = 500~m\) for \(A = 0.001~mW/m^3\)
  and \(q_b = 30~mW/m^2\). The variable, \(Z(u)\), in this case is
  additive because the arithmetic mean of the samples is a good
  approximation of the average sedimentary layer thickness,
  \((Z(u_1) + Z(u_2)) / 2 = 750~m\).
\item
  The age of young oceanic lithosphere can be approximated by
  \(q_s(t) = kT_b(\pi\kappa t)^{-1/2}\), where \(q_s(t)\) is the surface
  heat flow of a plate with age, \(t\), \(T_b\) is the temperature at
  the base of the plate, \(k\) is thermal conductivity, and
  \(\kappa = k/\rho C_p\) is thermal diffusivity (Stein \& Stein, 1992).
  For \(k = 3.138~W/mK\), \(\rho = 3330~kg/m^3\), \(C_p = 1171~J/kgK\),
  \(T_b = 1350^{\circ}C\), two samples, \(Z(u_1) = 180~mW/m^2\) and
  \(Z(u_2) = 190~mW/m^2\), would correspond to plates with ages of
  \(Z'(u_1) = 10~Ma\), and \(Z'(u_2) = 9~Ma\), respectively. Since
  \(Z(u_1) + Z(u_2) / 2 = 185~mW/m^2\) and
  \(Z'(185~mW/m^2) = 9.5~Ma = Z'(u_1) + Z'(u_2) / 2\), the variable
  \(Z(u)\) in this case is also additive.
\end{enumerate}

In contrast, Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions} is likely invalid in regions
that transition among two or more tectonic regimes. For example, the
expected heat flow \(E[Z(u)] = mean\) will change when moving from a
spreading center to a subduction zone. \(E[Z(u)] = mean \neq constant\)
over the region of interest. Proceeding with
Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions} in this case has the effect of masking the
geodynamic complexity. In other words, the spatial dependence is
considered in the Kriging method in this case, but the geodynamic
structure is \emph{invisible}. We will see that this has important
implications when comparing our Kriging method to Lucazeau (2019)'s
interpolation method, which is exactly opposite of this formalism---it
only considers the similarities among physical proxies and not spatial
dependence.

The second step is to fit the experimental variogram with a variogram
model, \(\gamma(h)\). In this study we fit three popular variogram
models to the experimental variogram. We use models with sills, which
implies the spatial dependence between pairs of points has a finite
range. The spherical, exponential, and Guassian variogram models are
defined as (Chiles \& Delfiner, 2009; Cressie, 2015):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:varmodels}{}{
\begin{aligned}
    sph &\leftarrow \gamma(h) =
        \begin{cases}
            n + s \left(\frac{3h}{2a} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{h}{a}\right)^3\right), & \quad\text{if } 0 \leq h \leq a \\
            n + s, & \quad\text{if } h > a
        \end{cases} \\
    exp &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = n + s \left(1 - exp\left(\frac{-h}{a}\right)\right), ~\quad\text{if } h \geq 0 \\
    Gau &\leftarrow \gamma(h) = n + s \left(1 - exp\left(\frac{-h^2}{a^2}\right)\right), \quad\text{if } h \geq 0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:varmodels}\end{equation}

where \(n\) is the nugget, \(s\) is the sill, and \(a\) is the effective
range. For spherical, exponential, and Gaussian models, the effective
range is related to the range, \(r\), by \(a = r\), \(a = r/3\), and
\(a=1/r\sqrt{3}\), respectively (Gräler et al., 2016; Pebesma, 2004).
The function \texttt{fit.variogram} in \texttt{gstat} allows one to try
many variogram models and the best will be selected by the minimum
misfit by weighted least square (WLS, Pebesma, 2004).

We use ordinary Kriging for our interpolation step, which predicts the
value of a random function, \(\hat{Z}(u)\) at unknown locations as a
linear combination of all known locations in the domain, \(D\)
(Bárdossy, 1997):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:linestimate}{}{ \hat{Z}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i), \quad \forall u \in D }\label{eq:linestimate}\end{equation}

The conditions in Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions} set up a constrained
minimization problem since one has:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:firstmoment}{}{ E[Z(u)] = mean, \quad \forall u \in D }\label{eq:firstmoment}\end{equation}

The linear estimator must obey

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:explinestimate}{}{ E[\hat{Z}(u)] = \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i E[Z(u_i)] = mean }\label{eq:explinestimate}\end{equation}

so the weights must be:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:unbiased}{}{ \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = 1 }\label{eq:unbiased}\end{equation}

This is the first constraint, also known as the unbiased condition,
which states that the sum of the weights must equal one. However, there
is an infinite set of real numbers one could use for the weights,
\(\lambda_i\). Our goal is to find the set of weights in
Equation~\ref{eq:linestimate} that minimizes the estimation variance.
This can be solved with the covariance function, \(C(h)\) from
Equation~\ref{eq:assumptions}:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:minvar}{}{
\begin{aligned}
    \sigma^2(u) = Var[Z(u) - \hat{Z}(u)] = E\left[(Z(u) - \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i))^2\right] &= \\
    E\left[Z(u)^2 + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i Z(u_j)Z(u_i) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i Z(u_i)Z(u)\right] &= \\
    C(0) + \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_j \lambda_i C(u_i - u_j) - 2 \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i C(u_i - u)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:minvar}\end{equation}

Solving for the weights in Equation~\ref{eq:linestimate} with respect to
the unbiased condition (Equation~\ref{eq:unbiased}) and minimum estimate
variance (Equation~\ref{eq:minvar}), yields the best linear unbiased
estimator (BLUE, Bárdossy, 1997). In our case, this is done by the
function \texttt{krige} in \texttt{gstat}.

\subsection{Kriging Optimization}

Achieving a useful Kriging results depends on one's choice of many
Kriging parameters (\(\Theta\)). In this study, we investigate a set of
parameters, \(\Theta\):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:params}{}{ \Theta = \{m, s, a, n, S\} }\label{eq:params}\end{equation}

where \(m\) is the model type (sph, exp, or Gau), \(s\) is the sill,
\(a\) is the effective range, \(n\) is the nugget, and \(S\) is the
maximum distance for local Kriging. Only points within \(S\) from the
prediction location are used for Kriging. Our goal is to find \(\Theta\)
such that our interpolation, \(f(x_i; \Theta)\), gives the most useful
outcome---defined by minimizing a cost function, \(C(\Theta)\), that
represents the error between the set of real observations, \(Z(u_i)\)
and predictions, \(\hat{Z}(u)\).

We define a cost function that simultaneously considers the misfit
between the experimental and modelled variogram and between the Kriging
predictions and observed heat flow (after Li et al., 2018):

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:cost}{}{ C(\Theta) = (1-w)C_F(\Theta) + wC_I(\Theta) }\label{eq:cost}\end{equation}

where \(C_F(\Theta)\) is the root mean square error (RMSE) of the
modelled variogram fit calculated by WLS, and \(C_I(\Theta)\) is the
RMSE of the Kriging result calculated by cross-validation. The weight,
\(w\), is set to 0.5 in our study, which balances the effects of
\(C_F(\Theta)\) and \(C_I(\Theta)\) on the cost function. The final
expression to minimize becomes:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq:costexp}{}{
\begin{aligned}
    \min(C(\Theta)) =
    \frac{1-w}{\sigma_E}&\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}w(h_k)[\hat{\gamma}(h_k)-\gamma(h_k;\Theta)]^2} \quad + \\
    \frac{w}{\sigma_S}&\sqrt{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}[Z(u_i)-\hat{Z}(u_i;\Theta)]^2}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq:costexp}\end{equation}

where N is the number of pairs of points used to calculate the
experimental variogram, \(\hat{\gamma}(h_k)\), \(\sigma_E\) is the
standard deviation of the experimental variogram, \(\hat{\gamma}(h)\),
\(w(h_k)\) is the weight in WLS and defines the importance of the
\(kth\) lag in the error estimate. We use \(w(h_k) = N_k/h_k^2\).
\(Z(u_i)\) and \(\hat{Z}(u_i; \Theta)\) are the measured and predicted
values, respectively, \(\sigma_s\) is the standard deviation of the
predicted values, \(\hat{Z}(u_i)\), and M is the number of measurements
in \(Z(u_i)\). For \(C_I(\Theta)\) we use ten-fold cross-validation,
which splits the dataset, \(|Z(u_i), ~\forall u_i \in D|\) into ten
equal intervals and tests one interval against the remaining nine. This
process is then repeated over all intervals so that the whole dataset
has been cross-validated.

Minimization of \(C(\Theta)\) is achieved by a genetic algorithm that
simulates biologic natural selection by differential success (Goldberg,
1989). Our procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Initiate fifty \emph{chromosomes}, \(\xi\), with random starting
  parameters defined within the search domain (Table~\ref{tbl:search})
\item
  Evaluate the fitness of each individual chromosome as \(-C(\Theta)\)
  for the entire population
\item
  Allow the population to exchange genetic information by sequentially
  performing genetic operations:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    Selection: the top 5\% fittest chromosomes survive each generation
  \item
    Crossover: pairs of chromosomes have an 80\% chance of exchanging
    genetic information
  \item
    Mutation: there is a 10\% chance for random genetic mutations
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Evaluate the fitness of the new population
\item
  If the termination criterion is met, do step (6), otherwise continue
  to evolve by repeating steps (3) and (4)
\item
  Decode the best chromosome and build the optimal variogram
\end{enumerate}

We use the general-purpose functions in the ``R'' package \texttt{GA}
(Scrucca, 2013, 2016) to perform each step in the above procedure.

\subsection{Map Projection and Interpolation Grid}

We interpolate onto the same 0.5\(^{\circ}\)C x 0.5\(^{\circ}\)C grid as
Lucazeau (2019) so a direct difference could be calculated between our
interpolation methods and Lucazeau (2019)'s. The NGHF and grid with
predicted heat flow from Lucazeau (2019) were transformed into a
Pacific-centered Robinson coordinate reference system (CRS) defined
using the \texttt{proj} string (PROJ contributors, 2021):

\begin{verbatim}
+proj=robin +lon_0=-155 +lon_wrap=-155 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs
\end{verbatim}

All geographic operations, including Kriging, are performed in the above
CRS using the general-purpose functions in the ``R'' package \texttt{sf}
(Pebesma, 2018). We define the Kriging domain near individual arc
segments in two steps: 1) 1000 \(km\) buffers are drawn around the arc
segments as defined by Syracuse \& Abers (2006). 2) The bounding box of
the 1000 \(km\) buffer is expanded by 10\% on all sides
(Figure~\ref{fig:segments}). We provide the complete NGHF dataset
(Lucazeau, 2019), filtered and parsed NGHF dataset, heat flow
interpolations (from Lucazeau, 2019, and this study), and our code as
supplementary information to support FAIR data policy (Wilkinson et al.,
2016). These items can also be retrieved from the official repository at
\url{https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CA6ZU}.
